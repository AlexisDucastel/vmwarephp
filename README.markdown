Vmwarephp
========
Vmwarephp is a library containing bindings for vSphere API using PHP. You can
use it to manage ESX and VCenter servers. It was inspired by other efforts of
constructing Vsphere bindings for other dynamically typed languages like RbvMomi
for Ruby. Currently the library supports vSphere API from version 4.1 to 5.0.1.
